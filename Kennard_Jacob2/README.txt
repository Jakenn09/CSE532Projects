***running each code block in order (1-4) should result in proper execution***

Located in this folder is the GatsbyBook.txt file as well as the gatsbyProject.ipynb file that contains all the code for this Project.
Running the code for this assignment is straight forward and in parts on the .ipynb file. To begin run Part Ones code block. This will
generate the first 15 words in the book and also is the creation of our wordList[]. Next in Part Two, we create the data frame. The code
block for this part can be run. On execution, the dataFrame will be shown working with the word, and count shown. In part three, upon running 
the code block, a newDataFrame is created removing all stop word from the stop_words list and putting the order as decending. the newDataFrame's
first 15 items are shown and the count is displayed below to show that the size of the new dataframe has decreased as indended. In the final part,
upon running this code block, plots for the top 6 words, and their frequency based on chapter are created. A function is utilized that takes a word from 
our topSix word list as an arguement, and gives us a ratio associated with a key for its chapter. This can be used to create the plots for the assignemnt.
