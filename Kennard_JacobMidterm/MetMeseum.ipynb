    "### Problem 5\n",
    "1. To begin this problem, I imported the numpy library. which is used to import the .where() method which is discussed further down.\n",
    "2. Created a copy of the previous dataframe which will be used in this problem.\n",
    "3. Created a new column in our dataframe called \"DecadesToMake\" and assigned it using basic arithmatic that calculates the difference in years between \"Object Begin Date\" and \"Object End Date\" using those column names. \n",
    "4. Floor division is used after the difference in years is calcualted to divide the two dates by ten, effectively converting our number to decades, and returns the number as an integer type to avoid floats.\n",
    "5. Next I wanted to replace any of the values that did not contain an \"Object End Date\" that would result in the difference being negative. To do this, I utilized the numpy library np.where function to replace all the negative values with a 0. This is done by passing 3 arguements. This function iterates through the \"DecadesToMake\" and looks for any value less than 0, replaces it with a 0 in that location, all values greater than 0 remain the same."
